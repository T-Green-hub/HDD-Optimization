A **low-noise, systemd-user HDD Load Cycle Count (LCC) logger** built for Linux Mint / Ubuntu systems.  
It monitors hard drives prone to excessive head parking by logging SMART data and helps verify APM/TLP tuning effectiveness over time.

## üß© Components

| Type | Path | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Script** | `scripts/lcc_log_once.sh` | Reads SMART attribute 193 (Load Cycle Count) via `smartctl` |
| **CSV Log** | `~/.local/share/hdd-watch/logs/lcc.csv` | Time-stamped historical record |
| **Systemd Service** | `~/.config/systemd/user/hdd-lcc-logger.service` | Executes logger once per trigger |
| **Timer** | `~/.config/systemd/user/hdd-lcc-logger.timer` | Runs **weekly (Sun 09:00)** |

## üí° Why

Aggressive head parking (from factory APM defaults) can quickly wear mechanical drives.  
This logger quietly tracks your disk‚Äôs **Load Cycle Count** to confirm that APM and spindown settings are stable and non-destructive.
